#WarpDrive submission:

Hello everyone,

zenonrewards.xyz will provide tools to help make optimal decisions on how to participate in Network of Momentum. The tools provided will include real-time, network-based APY statistics,

a reward calculator to help estimate potential rewards, a feature to tinker around with different network conditions and parameters, and an overview of active Pillars to showcase their reward share ratios and other statistics.

Other features could include: APY and reward statistics for a given address and general in-depth information on how to Stake, Delegate and run a Sentinel or Pillar.

These tools will help onboard and encourage new network participants and help existing participants choose an optimal strategy to maximize rewards for example.

To check out the work in progress, please visit: https://zenonrewards.xyz
