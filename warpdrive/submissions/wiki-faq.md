From the zenon-wiki maintainers:

<https://github.com/zenon-wiki/zenon-wiki/issues/1>

I am submitting the FAQ section as a WarpDrive entry open to the community to contribute to.

As a maintainer I will accept comments in this thread or merge requests that have well written and well sourced responses to commonly asked questions in the telegram channels. Every question and answer should ideally reference an official piece of documentation on from Medium or the official website.

Speculative elements should not be present in the FAQ.

To make Warpdrive reward distribution easy, please include a Syrius address as part of your submission or on your GitHub profile.

As clarification, even a single Question and Answer will be accepted. You don't have to write the entire FAQ

I will ask the WarpDrive judges to evaluate each Q/A on relevance and impact when it comes to rewards

Alphanet faq is needed regardless
Some sort of non speculative history is probably needed

Any sort of legacy or testnet questions is useful too but timely submission will be important

The questions that will flood the telegram groups in the next few weeks will encompass legacy, alphanet, and testnet

I think that is all fair game for now

But how much each bit of info is worth, I cannot say
That is for the judges to decide as a group

All good FAQs will go to the <https://zenon.wiki/faq> page
I may make some editorial decisions around grouping questions, reducing source redundancy etc.
