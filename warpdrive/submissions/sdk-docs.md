#Warpdrive submission: SDK documentation and code breakdowns

For proper decentralisation of the network it is imperative that community members are empowered to:
1. Understand how the network functions.
2. Write their own clients to interact with the network.

I have put analyses of a few example scripts of the Zenon network Dart SDK on zenon.wiki (<https://zenon.wiki/dart-sdk-docs/examples/>). Over the coming weeks to months, I intend to flesh these out into a full and detailed breakdown of the Dart SDK.

These guides are (intended to be) written at a level that even people with limited technical knowledge should be able to get a little information out of them, to help fulfil goal number 1. This documentation will also be detailed enough to assist developers in implementing community SDKs in different languages, to help fulfil goal number 2.

In the longer term I would also like to expand this documentation to include the Network of Momentum code (when it becomes available).
