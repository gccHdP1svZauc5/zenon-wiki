From georgezgeorgez:

I will enter a #warpdrive submission for researching and creating guides for securely using the Network of Momentum.

This is something that I must do for myself regardless which should also be relevant to everyone.

Hardware wallet integration is something that many community members have asked for.

I will explore existing hardware wallet solutions such as Ledger, but also DIY airgapped wallets such as SeedSigner.

I will also explore how the community can protect its keys through key pass phrases, key xor, multisig and other constructs.

Some methods may be network agnostic while others may be Zenon specific.

If you would like join me in this effort. Please contact me.
